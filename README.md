# Simple-3D-Scatterplot
A very basic, three-dimensional, XYZ scatterplot for intuitive data analysis
and viewing.

This project uses the HTML5 canvas element and javascript to draw data on a
 chart.

The UI is designed to be intuitive, so it can be navigated without any
explanation. It includes the following features:
- textarea which accepts tab, comma or space delimited data in three columns
- text inputs to allow the chart to be rotated around the X, Y or Z axis
- text inputs to resize axis limits and divisions
- text inputs to zoom and change point size

Possible future improvements:
- perspective
- mouse rotation
- mouse zoom
